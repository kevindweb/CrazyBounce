My version of doodle jump

Simplest form of the game
    - ball is always bouncing when it hits the top of a ledge
    - move while jumping - right/left arrows
    - 1 character - use with circle (costs nothing)
    - platforms to stand on - with random location on screen
        - make sure they do not overlap, remove if they do
    - view moves up, but never down
    - gravity mechanic
    - if player falls below player view, end game with height score, restart
